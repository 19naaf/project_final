## Vue App Tasks

In this project, we were tasked with creating an app using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, utilizing the Vue 3.0 framework. The project involved developing a task management application. The application needed to be capable of connecting to a database via Supabase (a platform providing Backend services), authenticating or registering a user, and offering the user the ability to add a new task, view previously added tasks(if any), edit tasks, delete tasks, or mark tasks as completed.

To achieve this, various tools commonly used in development with the Vue framework were applied. This included using individual components that could be utilized and called from different "views" of the page, often importing the required data through props, also utilized framework-specific elements such as reactive variables to enable dynamic usage of variables. Regarding the visual design, i wanted to for a minimalist style that is also functional and responsive.
